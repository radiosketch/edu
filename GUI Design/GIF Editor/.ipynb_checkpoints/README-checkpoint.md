# GIF Editor
by radiosketxh, made with tkinter and Pillow
> Editing a GIF frame-by-frame is so tedious, so this program will do it for you.  
To use it, make an edit as if the GIF was a typical image, and the program will automatically duplicate that edit across multiple frames.

## Features
- Copy/Paste Selection (TODO):
  - Copy and paste a box selection from the same frame.
  - Options exist to flip the selection vertically or horizontally before pasting again.
- Timeline Scrubbing (TBA)
