# GIF Editor Ideas
What is GIF Editor?
Personal project taken on for the purpose of learning GUI design.   Starting with my most familiar language, but exploring new solutions as issues are identified.

## Options
- Python w/ Tkinter & PIL
	- In progress already
	- Tkinter is becoming somewhat cumbersome, so I would like to explore the various options for creating an application with a well fleshed-out GUI.
- Javascript / Node.js w/ (Some image manipulation lib)
	- [Check out the kinds of libs that exist](https://flatlogic.com/blog/12-javascript-image-manipulation-libraries-for-your-next-web-app/)
