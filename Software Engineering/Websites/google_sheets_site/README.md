# Demo App  
While I work, I need a place to make simpler versions of some ideas before I can implement them into my final product. This folder also contains some code for a basic webapp made with javascript that utilizes the Canvas2D to draw blueprints for later use in the pipeline.  

Run the code yourself by hosting a local server from this folder.
