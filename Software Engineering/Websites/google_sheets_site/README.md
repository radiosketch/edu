Interact with a [Google Sheets database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHQIyAN-riwfkB8p25fGIvmPHKX-j4-6vXJGR_Mlsfs/edit#gid=1302769330) using a friendly Vuetify-based frontend.  

This site is incorporating a Google Sheet I made during my time at MoldX Inc.  
TODO: Before sharing this site as part of my portfolio, a new spreadsheet should be made to emulate functionality without sharing company information.

## App Scripts
### The code for this project can be found and edited [here](https://script.google.com/u/0/home/projects/1jF6pSyax4-pmmergljoftp1ux0U-cIvkHVJ3yVccJzJyA1FHYaTx5EbS/edit)  

This app makes use of App Scripts provided by Google, which serves as the backend for my site.

## Vuetify
### Documentation for Vuetify can be found [here](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/styles/spacing/)  

As I am most familiar with Vuetify, I will be using it to make the frontend for this app.
