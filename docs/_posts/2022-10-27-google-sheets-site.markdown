In an effort to help streamline customer interactions, I've been tasked with making a web-based tool for generating estimates which can be sent directly to clients of MoldX Inc.

The project currently exists as a proof-of-concept containing basic forms for getting and setting fields contained within the database. (in this case, a Google Sheet) No company information is available in the separate version provided here, but the functionality will follow my progress at the company.
